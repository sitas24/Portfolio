  <h1 style="color:white;"> ROBOTICS WHATTTTT!!! </h1>
  <p style="color:white;"><b> 
  <p><!-- Put bullet point here --> My viewpoint of robotics was completely skewed when I learned about the arduino board. The arduino board makes it much easier for people just starting off with robots to code easily and fix all the bugs in their code in a matter of minutes by just uploading it on the arduino board. Just the thought of being able to code a robot directly from my home computer excites me. With evolving innovations, robotics can function without humans, being able to do tedious tasks so humans can be even more innovative.
  <p><!-- Put bullet point here --> What worked the best for my group was talking about our code and just bouncing ideas off of each other. The only tweak I would like in my group is if we worked faster and more efficiently.
     
  <h1 style="color:white;"> Intro to robotics- Blinking LEDS!!! </h1>
    <p style="color:white;"><b> 
     <p><!-- Put bullet point here --> For the lightshow, we split up the parts by listening to the music and figure out which beat goes with which LED and so forth. 
     <p><!-- Put bullet point here --> What we could have done to improve our progress is by asking other groups what they did instead of taking the longer route and using up valuable time
     <p><!-- Put bullet point here --> The basic pieces of every Arduino sketch temperature sensor, a motion sensor, a distance sensor, light, a screen.

     <p><!-- Put bullet point here --> Circuit boards are intricate and complicated but with the right amount of experience it is easy to program. For example, I learned that on LED lights the shorter side is the cathode which is negative and must have the black wire which is attached to the ground on the breadboard while the longer side is the anode which is positive and is attached to the resistor.</p>
      
     <p>1. An MVC paradign is a design pattern to relate the user interface to underlying data models. It divides a given application into three interconnected parts in order to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to and accepted from the user.</p>
     <p>2. The key difference between a framework and a library is an inversion of control. When you call a method from a library, you are in control, but with a framework the control is inverted. The library solves a particular problem on or around a specific area of an application development. The framework is a collection of what is presented in the application.</p>
     <p>3. You might use a framework instead of creating the application yourself because it is efficient and does not require you to create a completely different code.</p>  
      
         
         <p>I would like to finish my django tutorial.</p>
         <p> I can create a text-based adventure game, or a blog based on humanly concerns.</p>
      <p>I would like more practice using python and HTML</p>
      <p>I do not understand using everything</p>
